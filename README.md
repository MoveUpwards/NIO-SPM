# Swift Package Manager with iOS

This project demonstrates a working method for using [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager) (SPM) to manage the dependencies of an iOS project. It has been tested with Xcode 9.1, using Swift 4 and the SPM v4 description format.

**Note:** At this time there is [no _official_ support for iOS targets or the related system libraries](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/Usage.md#depending-on-apple-modules) in SPM.

### To get started:

1. Install the `xcodeproj` ruby library: `sudo gem install xcodeproj`

2. **Run `ruby generate-project-dependencies.rb` in the project root directory**. This will pull down dependencies as defined in `Package.swift` and then generate and modify a _Dependencies_ project which is then included as a sub-project by the example project.

3. **Open `SwiftPackagesWithiOS.xcodeproj` in Xcode**

4. **Build the main target** (you may need to manually build the target for the _Dependencies_ sub-project).

This will build a simple app that depends on [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift). RxSwift was chosen because it shows how to handle modules generated from Objective-C.

The end result will be a standard iOS application, with Static Frameworks for each of its dependencies embedded within the bundle.

You can link the dependencies dynamically if you prefer, by removing the `config.build_settings['MACH_O_TYPE'] = 'staticlib'` line in `generate-project-dependencies.rb`. If you do this **you will need to [embed the dependencies in your main app target](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2435/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40017543-CH1-EMBED_IN_APP_SECTION)**.

You can step through the commits to see what steps were taken, with a brief overview of the process below.

### Process:

_(This process hasn't been tested with Xcode 8.3 & Swift 3.1)_

1. Generate iOS App project with Xcode
2. Generate swift package for Dependencies
3. Create dummy source file for Dependencies (I've chosen to put this in `.deps-sources` but does not necessarily need to be hidden)
4. Modify build settings in generated xcodeproj (this is done in `generate-project-dependencies.rb`)
5. Add Dependencies.xcodeproj as subproject of the main app xcodeproj
6. Add a dependency (to RxSwift in this example) in Package.swift
7. Link our App with the new Rx*.frameworks
8. Write some sample code to verify that the import works
9. Override MODULEMAP_FILE setting for non-Swift modules
